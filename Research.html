						<h3>Union County Arts Council Website</h3>
					</header>
					<p>The Union County Arts Council is an organization
						that essentially is location driven, and uses their space for galleries,
						classes, and other fine art events for the local county. Their about page is very small, and only
						states mainly that "UCAC sponsors many events throughout the year that help enrich the arts
						experience of the residents of Union and surrounding counties." </p>

										<h4>Davis Arts Center</h2>
									</header>

									<div class="inner">
										<div class="image left">
											<img src="images/davisartscenter.org_.png" width=50% height=50% alt=""/>
										</div>

										<p> Davis Art Center was a unique find, because what
											caught my attention was an article related to how they responded to COVID.
											Their solution was to pack art kits for their campers, and have a zoom session where
											friends could meet with one another, and work on art. </p>

										<h4>What Didn't Work</h2>
									</header>

									<header>
										<h5>Community Art Center</h5>
									</header>

									<div class="inner">
										<div class="image">
											<img src="images/www.communityartcenter.org_.png" width=50% height=50% alt=""/>
										</div>

										<p> I could have included many bad examples,
											but this one clearly showed the issue I kept seeing: overall uninviting, and very unclear.
											 Many links went to the same area, and as a user, I felt stuck.</p>





									<header>
										<h4>What Worked Very Well</h2>
									</header>

									<header>
										<h5>Art House Charlotte</h5>
									</header>

									<div class="inner">
										<div class="image Right">
											<img src="images/www.arthousecharlotte.com_.png" width=50% height=50% alt=""/>

											<p> What inspired me here from this website was the simple grid layout presented,
												making the elements visually easy to read. Another element was the limitations of
												 two colors for the background and headings, etc.</p>


											<header>
												<h5>Ogden Art Center</h5>
											</header>

											<div class="inner">
												<div class="image">
													<img src="images/ogdencontemporaryarts.org_ (1).png" width=50% height=50% alt=""/>

													<div class="inner">
														<div class="image">
															<img src="images/ogdencontemporaryarts.org_.png" width=50% height=50% alt=""/>

															<div class="inner">
																<div class="image">
																	<img src="images/ogdencontemporaryarts.org_ (4).png" width=50% height=50% alt=""/>



																	<p> This one is my favorite and best result. I found this from a Google Ad, not even my search result.
																		There is a lot to unpack. The branding works very well, from the color scheme to the typeface choice.
																		The layout is simple yet very informative, making it easy to nagivate. </p>

									<h2>Interview</h2>
									</header>




									<h3>UCAC</h3>

									<p>I was able to reach someone at the organization! I had the privilege
										 of speaking to Tina Cordell. She did not tell me her position, but I know she does a lot.

									 My interview was extremely successful, because there was not necessarily any new information,
									 but what she did do was confirm my findings. For example, she was able to confirm to me that the purpose of
									 the website was to simply inform for upcoming events, and also they are wanting to put art for sale as well.
									 She also confirmed that UCACs audience is everyone. However, she did say a lot of events circulated around
									 children, so there is a slight emphasis on that, but overall the age range is vast. Here is what they offer:</p>




									 <ul>
										 <li>Wine Tasting in March</li>
										 <li>Chalk Walk</li>
										 <li>Art Show for local school</li>
										 <li>Various Exhibitions</li>
										 <li>Summer Art Camps for K through 2nd Grade, 3rd through 6th and 7th-10th.</li>
										 <li>Adults with disabilities do not need to pay</li>
										 <li>Ladies Painting with Coffee</li>
										 <li>Monday Night Music</li>
										 <li>Big Art Show in September</li>
									 </ul>

									 <p>She also told me that they changed emails, and the newest version was a long string
										 of numbers following UCAC. Finally, she told me that to make the website they used
										 free and cheap templates to make it.

 									</p>

									<header>
									<h3>Mrs. Hammond</h3>
									</header>

									<p>My user for the website was my friends mom. She teaches art at her school
										and is familiar with managing art camps. I was very happy to get her input in regards to the site.

										I felt it was best to get her raw reaction to everything, so I had her go to the website.
										What she felt needed to be changed was first, the home page needed to say what the art center is about.
										Secondly, things should be easy to find, and the image size should be changed. Overall it needed better organization, and for things to be clearer.

										Her concluding statement was that it looked unprofessional.

									</p>

									<header>
									<h3>Interview Takeaways</h3>
									</header>

									<p>These interviews were very helpful. I am definitely going to apply what
										Mrs. Hammond said to convey what Mrs. Cordell said in a much organized and clearer light.
										One word that will be the theme of this project is cohesiveness. Im planning to strip away all
										of the websites decorative elements and rearrange the structure to be better suited for navigation.

									</p>
