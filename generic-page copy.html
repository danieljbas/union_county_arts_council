					<h3>What is the problem you are trying to solve?</h3>
					<p>Bettering the user experience and organization for an art centers website.</p>

					<h3>Make it a question.</h3>
					<p>How might I better the user experience and organization for an art centers website?</p>

					<h3>What is the ultimate impact?</h3>
					<p>For the community to feel more united through the UCAC website, and for there to be familiarity.</p>

					<h3>What are some possible solutions?</h3>
					<p>The website needs to be clearer visually and have better cohesiveness flowing between its social media and the site itself.</p>

					<h3>What are some possible constraints?</h3>
					<p>A lot of advertisements and tabs have a different design that are not as unified as they can be.</p>

					<h3>Make a New Question!</h3>
					<p>How might UCACs website be even more unified and community friendly to invite more users from the Union County area?</p>
